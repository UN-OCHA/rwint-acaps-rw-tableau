ReliefWeb API Web Data Connector for Tableau - by ACAPS

Are you using Tableau software? If yes, this post can be useful for you!
Our colleagues at ACAPS have developed a connector between ReliefWeb and Tableau through ReliefWeb API. It allows to get the data about the disasters, reports and jobs posted in ReliefWeb since the beginning of times (well, since there is data in ReliefWeb, which is 1996).
For each of the content types you can choose what countries and dates are you interested in for your analysis.
After that, you can use the dimensions (equivalent to the facets of ReliefWeb) provided by the connector to analyze ReliefWeb data through themes, affected vulnerable groups or any other.

You can download this source code and install the connector in your own server (or even a laptop with WAMPP/XAMPP). It is very easy to set up a local server. For doing so, just install the software http://www.wampserver.com/en/. There are many tutorials on Internet. After you install WAMP/XAMPP, just copy the files into /htdocs/acaps-rw-tableau and the connector will be available at http://localhost/acaps-rw-tableau

For using it with Tableau, follow this instructions for Windows http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/online/windows/en-us/help.html#examples_web_data_connector.html and this for Mac https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/online/mac/en-us/examples_web_data_connector.html
